CSVTK Provides functions and mappings to help working with CSV files or
any files where a separator (e.g. a comma) is used between values and
where values can be enclosed between delimiters (e.g. double quotes).
Separators characters inside delimiters are not considered as separators.

Field numberting starts at 1.

Mappings allow user to:
  * Jump to a specific field,
  * Display the field number of the field under the cursor,
  * Return the value of field (given the field number) on current line or
  specified line,
  * Toggle highlighting for each field (in one or several colors).

The highlight will show in the current line and be updated when user 
changes line (the highlight is updated thanks to an autocomand on the 
CursorHold event, therefore it is not updated when in insert mode). The 
separator following the field is highlighted as part of the field.

Also, a few examples are provided to show how to display the current field
number in the status line (so you always know what field you're in) and
how to fold lines depending on field content.
